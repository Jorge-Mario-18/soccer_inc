Hello! 

This is my first data analysis project with an emphasis on soccer/football.
In this project I measure the use of "The Cloud" asset management service. 
I calculate the login usage over a 3 year period and the storage being used by the company in "The Cloud" 
I did everything in Google Colabs.
I feel like some process could have been shorten or done with a loop, especially the data processing.
Let me know what you think!
